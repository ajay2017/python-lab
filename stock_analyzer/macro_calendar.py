Economic Calendar — static backbone + FMP live layer.

Static backbone:  FOMC, CPI, NFP, GDP, PPI, Retail Sales 2025-2026
                  Published months in advance by Fed / BLS / BEA — 100% reliable.
FMP live layer:   Financial Modeling Prep free tier (250 calls/day, no credit card).
                  Enriches static events with estimate/previous/actual values and
                  adds secondary events (PMI, housing, confidence surveys).

Portfolio impact: maps each event category to affected sectors, then to the
                  user's specific holdings — the key differentiator vs a plain
                  macro calendar.
